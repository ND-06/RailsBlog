# RailsBlog
This blog has been made by myself and Nikita Vasilev during our Intensive Bootcamp called "The Hacking Project".
During this Bootcamp, we have learned HTML5 / CSS3 / JS / Ruby / RubyOnRails / Bootstrap / Postgresql / SqlLite3 / Ajax and Jquery.
We decided to build from scratch a complete blog in order to give tips for future students of The Hacking Project.
This app has been build with Postgresql, RubyOnRails, Bootstrap and also Disqus for comments.
This blog is full responsive.
Content of the blog will evolve during next weeks and months.
You can find the link production here : https://stackovernice.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy and stay tuned for others apps and programs !
